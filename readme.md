# Business Solutions Firm Landing Page

**Hi everyone, I am Raushan.**

>This project was a landing page of a business solution firm website built purely in HTML and CSS😎.

>This one was a good project to deal with multiple images and manipulating their sizes and their position with `flexbox`. This project also strengthened my ability to write more modular HTML class structure😀 that makes styling by CSS more easy and fun. 

-Key learning from the project👇👇👇
    - image positioning using `flexbox`
    - HTML class structure
    - new type of footer design

>This project took 4 hours to complete.

Below is the link and view of the project👇👇👇
